# API Development Project: Tasks Management

This API is a **learning project API** I developed to test my **backend tech** skills. And also for people to see my development skills and experience.

For the development of this project, I will use the following tech stack:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language.
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) for building the APIs.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) Databases, along with an ORM called [SQLAlchemy.](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers.
- Flask and Python libraries.

This project is developed under an **open-source software license.** Feel free to comment or send a personal message for details or other information.

## API Functionality

This API allows users to manage their tasks. It has endpoints for _adding_, _updating_, _deleting_, and _viewing_ tasks. The API also provides _authentication_ so user can only see their tasks, _register_ and _log in._

## Build/CLI Instructions

## Configuration and Environment Variables

This project uses different **environment variables** to configure the application functionality. The following list shows each variable along its definition.

_You need to pass the variables so the application can run._
